- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Grant.

  I am a postgraduate student from a chemistry background learning the art of data science and I am relatively new to coding.
- Iâ€™m interested in entering a career within the field of computer science, and so with Github I hopefully have a space to present challenges I have embarked.
- Currently I am learning to code with Python! I am progressing quickly with this trivial, high generation programming language and so far have mostly used libraries such as Pandas,
- Matplotlib and Numpy.
- Furhter on in my studies, I shall be expanding my library 'go-to's by working with Seaborn, and I shall be introduced to machine learning.
- Outside of my curicculum, I anticipate myself becoming likewise fluent in R, and SQL.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on increasilingly more exciting challenges as my programming knowledege and ability broadens, so that I can learn from others to change my way of thinking. 
- 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Computer science is an exceptional tool in the field of chemistry / quantum mechanics. Properties of complex molecular structues can be estimated accurately through deep database extractions, such as
- local minima value energy values. More interestling, thanks to computer software, electronic structure can be mapped through Density Functional Theory (DFT).
